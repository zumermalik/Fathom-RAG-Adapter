# Fathom-RAG-Adapter


Fathom RAG Adapter is a next-generation **agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework** designed to transform any LLM into a self-optimizing knowledge engine. It acts as an intelligent middleware layer that autonomously plans retrieval, critiques outputs, and adapts its behavior to domain-specific tasks.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🧠 1. Agentic Retrieval
Breaks complex queries into reasoning steps and selects the best retrieval approach:
- Semantic Search  
- Hybrid Dense + Sparse Search  
- Structured/SQL Retrieval  
- Multi-step Retrieval Planning  

### 🛰️ 2. Adaptive Knowledge Routing
Learns which sources and vector stores provide the highest-quality answers and routes queries intelligently.

### 🔍 3. Context Optimization Engine
Automatically:
- sorts  
- clusters  
- compresses  
- expands  
- reorders  
retrieved chunks to maximize answer quality.

### 🛡️ 4. Self-Critique + Verification Loop
The adapter performs:
- hallucination detection  
- contradiction scanning  
- evidence scoring  
- reference validation  

### 🧩 5. Modular + Plug-and-Play
Compatible with:
- Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, pgvector  
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Llama, Mistral  
- Any embedding model / reranker  

### 🧬 6. Memory + Personalization (Optional)
Maintains evolving long-term memory:
- past queries  
- user preferences  
- custom datasets
